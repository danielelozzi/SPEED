# Default Tracker Configuration for SPEED
# This file uses the BoT-SORT tracker, a robust option for object tracking.

# Type of tracker to use. Options: 'botsort', 'bytetrack'
tracker_type: botsort

# --- BoT-SORT specific settings ---

# High-confidence detection threshold. Detections above this are used to start new tracks.
track_high_thresh: 0.5

# Low-confidence detection threshold. Detections between low and high are used to associate with existing tracks but not to start new ones.
track_low_thresh: 0.1

# If a detection has a score higher than this, it can be used to create a new track.
new_track_thresh: 0.6

# Number of frames to keep a track alive without any new detections.
track_buffer: 30

# IoU threshold for matching detections to existing tracks in the first association stage.
match_thresh: 0.8

# --- Re-identification (Re-ID) settings ---
# These settings are only used if tracker_type is 'botsort'.

# Set to True to enable the Re-ID model for more robust tracking across occlusions.
# This requires more computational resources.
# If set to True, you must also select a Re-ID model (e.g., yolov8n-reid.pt) in the GUI.
with_reid: False

# Minimum IoU for two tracks to be considered "close" enough for Re-ID comparison.
proximity_thresh: 0.5

# Minimum appearance similarity score for two detections to be considered the same object.
# Lower values are more lenient, higher values are stricter.
appearance_thresh: 0.25

# --- Global Motion Compensation (GMC) settings ---
# Helps stabilize tracking when the camera is moving.
# Options: 'orb', 'ecc', 'none'
gmc_method: 'orb'
