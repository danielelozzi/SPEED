SPEED: A GUI-Software for Processing Neon Eye Trackers Data
This software called SPEED (LabScoc Processing and Extraction of Eye tracking Data) is presented for processing data acquired by Pupil Lab Neon (Pupil Labs, Berlin,Germany). The software is written in Python which helps researchers with the feature extraction step. 

It is developed by the members and collaborators of the LabSCoC - Laboratorio di Scienze Cognitive e del Comportamento (Cognitive and Behavioural Science Lab) - at University of L'Aquila (https://labscoc.wordpress.com/)

Authors: Daniele Lozzi, Ilaria Di Pompeo, Martina Marcaccio, Matias Ademaj, Simone Migliore, Giuseppe Curcio.

Instructions:

2) download all files from Pupil Cloud video using "Marker Mapper" enrichment function
3) rename the internal video as "internal.mp4" 
4) rename the video from external camera as "external.mp4"
5) run SPEED

The gaze not enriched file in the analysis file folder must also be included called "gaze_not_enr.csv"
