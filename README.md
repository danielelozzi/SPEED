SPEED (v0.2) - Eye-Tracking Data Analysis SoftwareüéØ OverviewSPEED (v0.2) is a comprehensive eye-tracking data analysis software developed by the Laboratorio di Scienze Cognitive e del Comportamento. It provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for processing raw eye-tracking data, extracting meaningful features, generating various visualizations, and creating an integrated analysis video.The software is designed to streamline the analysis workflow for researchers working with eye-tracking data, particularly from Pupil Labs devices (though adaptable if data formats match).‚ú® FeaturesIntuitive GUI: Easy selection of required eye-tracking data files (CSV and MP4).Participant Management: Specify a participant name for organized output.Automated Data Preparation: Copies and renames input files to standard formats in a dedicated eyetracking_file directory.Event-Based Analysis: Processes data segmented by events defined in events.csv.Feature Extraction: Calculates key metrics for:Fixations (number, duration, position)Blinks (number, duration)Pupillometry (start, end, average, std diameter)Gaze Movements (number, duration, displacement)Comprehensive Visualizations (PDF):Pupil diameter periodograms and spectrograms.Histograms for gaze elevation, pupil diameter, fixation duration, blink duration, and saccade duration.Gaze path and fixation path plots.Heatmaps of fixation density.Movement path plots.Integrated Analysis Video (MP4): Combines internal (eye) and external (scene) video feeds with a real-time pupil diameter time series plot.Summary Results: Aggregates all calculated features into a single summary_results_<participant_name>.csv file.Error Handling: Provides informative messages for missing files or processing errors.üìÅ Required Input FilesThe software expects a specific set of files, which will be copied into the eyetracking_file subdirectory within your output folder and renamed to the standard names if they differ:Standard FilenameDescriptionFormatevents.csvEye-tracking events dataCSVgaze.csvEnriched gaze dataCSVgaze_not_enr.csvUn-enriched gaze data (for plotting)CSV3d_eye_states.csv3D eye states data (pupil diameter)CSVfixations.csvDetected fixations dataCSVblinks.csvDetected blinks dataCSVsaccades.csvDetected saccades dataCSVinternal.mp4Video feed from the internal (eye) cameraMP4external.mp4Video feed from the external (scene) cameraMP4üöÄ Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.8+Required Python libraries (install via pip):pip install pandas numpy matplotlib opencv-python scipy pathlib
InstallationClone this repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/SPEED.git
cd SPEED
Install the required dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt # (Assuming you create a requirements.txt from the above list)
UsageRun the GUI:python SPEED_0_2_gui.py
Enter Participant Name: In the GUI, type the name of the participant (e.g., subj_001).Select Files: Click "Browse..." next to each required file type (events.csv, gaze.csv, etc.) and select the corresponding file from your system.Start Analysis: Click the "Start Analysis" button.The GUI will show status updates. Once completed, a success message will appear.üìä OutputAll results will be saved in a new directory named analysis_results_<participant_name> (e.g., analysis_results_subj_001) in the same location where you run the script.This directory will contain:eyetracking_file/: A copy of all input data files, renamed to their standard names.summary_results_<participant_name>.csv: A CSV file containing all aggregated summary features for each event.Individual PDF plots for each event (e.g., periodogram_subj_001_Event1.pdf, hist_fixations_subj_001_Event2.pdf).output_analysis_video.mp4: The combined video showing internal view, external view, and pupil diameter over time.üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure.

üß† Core Logic (speed_script_10_events.py)This script contains the main algorithms for processing eye-tracking data.Key Functions:load_all_data(): Loads all necessary CSV files.filter_data_by_event(): Filters data for a specific event based on timestamps.process_gaze_movements(): Identifies and quantifies periods of gaze movement (non-fixations).calculate_summary_features(): Computes various statistical measures for fixations, blinks, pupil diameter, and movements.generate_plots(): Creates and saves various types of plots (histograms, paths, heatmaps, spectral analysis).downsample_video(): Utility function to reduce video frame rate.create_analysis_video(): Combines video feeds and pupil time series into an integrated output video.run_analysis(): The orchestrator function that drives the entire analysis pipeline, called by the GUI.ü§ù AuthorsDaniele LozziIlaria Di PompeoMartina MarcaccioMatias AdemajSimone MiglioreGiuseppe CurcioüìÑ LicenseThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.
