# SPEED (labScoc Processing and Extraction of Eye tracking Data)

*Eye-Tracking Data Analysis Software*

SPEED is a Python-based tool with a graphical user interface (GUI) for processing and analyzing eye-tracking data from cognitive and behavioral experiments. It is designed to segment data based on predefined events, calculate key metrics, and generate visualizations of eye movements like gaze paths and fixations.

The tool can handle both raw (un-enriched) and surface-projected (enriched) eye-tracking data, making it flexible for various stages of the analysis pipeline.

## Features ‚ú®

* **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: An intuitive `Tkinter`-based interface for easy file selection and configuration.
* **Event-Based Segmentation**: Analyzes eye-tracking data in segments defined by timestamps in an `events.csv` file.
* **Dual Analysis Mode**: Supports both "un-enriched" (pixel-based) and "enriched" (surface-normalized) data. If enriched data is provided, the tool can run a dual analysis to produce results for both modes.
* **Path Plot Generation**: Automatically creates and saves PDF plots for fixation paths and raw gaze paths for each event segment.
* **Summary Statistics**: Generates a final CSV file with aggregated metrics for each analysis segment.
* **Automated File Management**: Creates a structured output folder for each participant, copying input files and saving results neatly.

## Environment Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

To run the SPEED analysis tool, you'll need Python 3 and several scientific computing libraries. It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

1.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv speed-env
    source speed-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `speed-env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    Based on the scripts, the required libraries are `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `opencv-python`, and `scipy`. Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    pandas
    numpy
    matplotlib
    opencv-python
    scipy
    ```
    Then, install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: `Tkinter` is part of the Python standard library and does not require a separate installation.*

## How to Use the Application üöÄ

1.  **Launch the GUI**: Run the `SPEED_gui.py` script from your terminal.
    ```bash
    python SPEED_gui.py
    ```

2.  **Fill in the Information**:
    * **Participant Name**: Enter a unique identifier for the participant. This name will be used to create the main output folder.
    * **Output Folder**: The application will automatically suggest an output path based on the participant's name (e.g., `./analysis_results_participant_name`). You can also use the "Browse..." button to select a different location.
    * **Analysis Options**:
        * `Analyze un-enriched data only`: Check this if you only want to process data using pixel coordinates from the raw eye-tracking files (`fixations.csv`, `gaze.csv`). This will disable the input fields for enriched data files.
        * `Generate Analysis Video`: If checked, the tool will attempt to create a video overlay of the analysis (this is a slower process).

3.  **Select Input Files**:
    * Click the "Browse..." button next to each file type to select the corresponding data file for your participant. See the table below for a description of each file.

4.  **Start the Analysis**:
    * Once all required fields are filled and files are selected, click the **"Start Analysis"** button.
    * The status label at the bottom will show the progress of the analysis.
    * Upon successful completion, a confirmation message will appear, and the results will be available in the specified output folder.

## Input Files üìÇ

The application requires several specific CSV and MP4 files from your eye-tracking experiment. The `REQUIRED_FILES` are listed below.

| Standard Name | Display Label (in GUI) | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `events.csv` | `events.csv` | Contains timestamps that define the start and end of experimental segments. | **Always** |
| `gaze_enriched.csv` | `gaze CSV file (enriched)` | Gaze data with coordinates normalized to a detected surface. | Optional (if "un-enriched only" is checked) |
| `fixations_enriched.csv` | `enriched fixations CSV file` | Fixation data with coordinates normalized to a detected surface. | Optional (if "un-enriched only" is checked) |
| `gaze.csv` | `un-enriched gaze CSV file` | Raw gaze data with coordinates in pixels (`px`). | **Always** |
| `fixations.csv` | `un-enriched fixations CSV file` | Raw fixation data with coordinates in pixels (`px`). | **Always** |
| `3d_eye_states.csv` | `3D eye states CSV file (pupil)` | Pupil diameter and other 3D eye model data. | **Always** |
| `blinks.csv` | `blinks CSV file` | Data on blink events. | **Always** |
| `saccades.csv` | `saccades CSV file` | Data on saccadic movements. | **Always** |
| `internal.mp4` | `internal camera video` | The video recording of the participant's eye. | **Always** |
| `external.mp4` | `external camera video` | The video recording of the participant's scene/view. **Used to get video dimensions.** | **Always** |

### Output Files üìà

The analysis generates a main folder named `analysis_results_{participant_name}` with the following contents:

1.  **`eyetracking_file/`**
    * A subfolder containing copies of all the input files used for the analysis. This ensures reproducibility.

2.  **Summary Results (`.csv`)**
    * `summary_results_{subj_name}.csv`: A CSV file containing the main quantitative outcomes of the analysis. It includes one row per event segment and columns for various metrics like number of fixations, average fixation duration, pupil diameter statistics, and movement characteristics.

3.  **Analysis Plots (`.pdf`)**
    * These plots visualize different aspects of the eye-tracking data for each event segment.
    * `hist_fixations_{subj_name}_{event_name}.pdf`: A histogram of fixation durations.
    * `hist_blinks_{subj_name}_{event_name}.pdf`: A histogram of blink durations.
    * `hist_saccades_{subj_name}_{event_name}.pdf`: A histogram of saccade durations.
    * `path_fixation_{subj_name}_{event_name}.pdf`: A plot showing the sequence and path of fixations. The coordinates are normalized from 0 to 1.
    * `periodogram_{subj_name}_{event_name}.pdf`: A Power Spectral Density plot of the pupil diameter signal, showing frequency components.
    * `spectrogram_{subj_name}_{event_name}.pdf`: A spectrogram of the pupil diameter, showing how its frequency content changes over time.

4.  **Analysis Video (`.mp4`)**
    * `output_analysis_video.mp4`: An MP4 video that synchronizes the internal (eye) view, the external (scene) view, and a real-time plot of the pupil diameter. This is only generated if the "Generate Analysis Video" option is checked.
